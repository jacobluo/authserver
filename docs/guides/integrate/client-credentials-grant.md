# Client Credentials Grant — mint machine-to-machine tokens

*Context: this is part of [Guides — Integrate](README.md). Start with the primer if you haven't.*

**Audience:** Builders / operators standing up machine-to-machine auth — a backend worker, CI job, monitoring agent, or any service that needs to call an MCP server as itself, with no user in the loop.

## What you'll achieve in 10 minutes

- `client_credentials` enabled on Authplane
- A confidential OAuth client registered with `--grant-types client_credentials`
- A successful `access_token` minted via `POST /oauth/token`
- The token accepted by your MCP server with the correct `aud` and `scope`

For a deeper architectural picture, see [Concepts → Delegation & agent chains](../../concepts/delegation-and-agent-chains.md). This recipe is operator-shaped.

## Prereqs

- Authplane running on `http://localhost:9000` (public) / `http://localhost:9001` (admin), with `AUTHPLANE_ADMIN_API_KEY` exported.
- An MCP server registered as a [Mint Resource](../../concepts/glossary.md#glossary-mint-backend) (see [Connect an MCP Server](connect-mcp-server.md)).
- Concept context: [Client credentials grant](../../concepts/glossary.md#glossary-client-credentials-grant), [Access token](../../concepts/glossary.md#glossary-access-token), [Resource indicator](../../concepts/glossary.md#glossary-resource-indicator), [Scope](../../concepts/glossary.md#glossary-scope).

## When NOT to use this

- A user is involved and should authorize what the service does → use the authorization code flow.
- A service needs to act *on behalf of a user* (e.g., use the user's GitHub token) → use [Token Exchange](../upstream-providers/token-exchange-grant.md).
- A bot needs its own upstream-provider access → register a service-account user and follow the service-account pattern in [Token Exchange](../upstream-providers/token-exchange-grant.md). Self-impersonating a `client_credentials` token onto a broker grant is not supported.

## Steps

### 1. Confirm the grant is enabled on Authplane

It is on by default as of v0.2.0. If an operator turned it off, or you want to pin the token lifetime, set the env vars and restart:

```bash
# Variables verified against docs/reference/env-vars.md
export AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED=true
export AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1h
```

Or in YAML — see [`docs/reference/configuration.md#client_credentials`](../../reference/configuration.md#config-client-credentials):

```yaml
client_credentials:
  enabled: true
  token_expiry: 1h
```

**Recommendation:** keep `token_expiry` short (15m-1h). Machine clients re-authenticate instantly, so there's no UX cost. There is no refresh token for this grant — by design.

### 2. Register the client

The client needs `grant_types=client_credentials` and at least one scope. Pick `--auth-method client_secret_post` (or `client_secret_basic`) — `none` is for public clients and won't work here.

> **Machine clients are registered here, not through DCR.** `POST /oauth/register` creates user-delegated clients and never grants scopes, so a `client_credentials` client created that way has an empty ceiling: every explicit scope fails with `invalid_scope`. See [Which door a client comes through](../../concepts/resources-and-scopes.md#which-door-a-client-comes-through).

```bash
# Command verified against docs/reference/cli.md#cli-admin-client-create
authserver admin client create \
  --name backend-worker \
  --grant-types client_credentials \
  --auth-method client_secret_post \
  --scope "mcp:echo mcp:query_database"
```

The response prints the `client_id` and `client_secret`. **Store the secret in a secret manager now — it is bcrypt-hashed on disk and never returned again.**

Equivalent admin API:

```bash
# Wire shape verified against docs/reference/http-api.md#http-admin-clients-create
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:9001/admin/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHPLANE_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_name": "backend-worker",
    "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post",
    "scope": "mcp:echo mcp:query_database"
  }'
```

### 3. Mint a token

Always include `resource=` — this sets the JWT `aud` to the MCP server you intend to call. Without it, the token's `aud` defaults to the issuer and your MCP server will reject it.

```bash
# Wire shape verified against docs/reference/http-api.md#http-public-oauth-token
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:9000/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "resource=http://localhost:8080/mcp" \
  -d "scope=mcp:echo"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1Ni…",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "mcp:echo"
}
```

### 4. Call the MCP server

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo","arguments":{"message":"hi"}}}'
```

When the token expires, request a fresh one. There is no refresh token: the client re-authenticates with its secret. This keeps the blast radius small if a token leaks.

## Token shape

Machine tokens are JWTs (RFC 9068). The defining difference from user tokens: `sub == client_id`, because there is no user.

```json
{
  "iss": "http://localhost:9000",
  "sub": "<client_id>",
  "aud": ["http://localhost:8080/mcp"],
  "client_id": "<client_id>",
  "scope": "mcp:echo",
  "jti": "<unique-id>",
  "iat": 1709300000,
  "exp": 1709303600
}
```

## Scope resolution

| Request includes `scope`? | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Yes, all requested scopes are in the client's registered set | Token gets exactly the requested scopes |
| Yes, but some requested scopes are NOT in the registered set | Request fails with `invalid_scope` |
| No | Token gets ALL the client's registered scopes |

Always request only what you need — a stolen token with fewer scopes does less damage.

## Verify

```bash
# Wire shape verified against docs/reference/http-api.md#http-public-oauth-introspect
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:9000/oauth/introspect \
  -d "token=$ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" | jq .
# Expect: {"active": true, "scope": "mcp:echo", "client_id": "...", "aud": ["..."], ...}
```

Decode the JWT payload to confirm `aud`, `scope`, and `sub`:

```bash
echo "$ACCESS_TOKEN" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq '{iss,sub,aud,scope}'
```

## What can go wrong

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `unsupported_grant_type` | `client_credentials.enabled: false` on the server | Set `AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED=true` and restart ([env-vars.md](../../reference/env-vars.md)) |
| `unauthorized_client` | Client's `grant_types` doesn't include `client_credentials` | Recreate with `--grant-types client_credentials` or update via admin API |
| `invalid_client` | Wrong `client_id` or `client_secret`, or `--auth-method` was `none` | Re-check both values (case-sensitive); register with `--auth-method client_secret_post` or `client_secret_basic` |
| `invalid_scope` — "created through dynamic registration" | The client came from `POST /oauth/register` or CIMD, which create user-delegated clients | Create a machine client instead: `authserver admin client create --grant-types client_credentials --scope '...'`. Patching the DCR client is not the fix |
| `invalid_scope` — "the client has no registered scopes" | An admin-provisioned client was created without any scope | Grant them: `authserver admin client update --id <id> --scope '...'` |
| `invalid_scope` — "exceeds the client's registered scopes" | The client has scopes, but the request asked for one outside that set | Narrow the request, or widen the client with `authserver admin client update --id <id> --scope '...'`. No admin surface reads the ceiling back, so set it explicitly rather than trying to inspect it |
| Token mints fine but MCP server rejects with audience mismatch | Missing or wrong `resource=` on the token request | Add `-d "resource=<canonical-uri>"` matching the Resource's `--uri` byte-for-byte |
| Stolen `client_secret` | Logs, env-var dumps, leaked Docker images | (1) `PATCH /admin/clients/{id}/suspend`, (2) `POST /oauth/revoke` for live tokens, (3) `authserver admin client rotate-secret --id <id>` ([cli.md#cli-admin-client-rotate-secret](../../reference/cli.md#cli-admin-client-rotate-secret)), (4) audit logs |

## Revocation

Revoke an active token immediately:

```bash
# Wire shape verified against docs/reference/http-api.md#http-public-oauth-revoke
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:9000/oauth/revoke \
  -d "token=$ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET"
```

After revocation the token returns `"active": false` on introspection and is rejected by token exchange.

## DPoP binding (optional)

If DPoP is enabled on Authplane, the client can include a `DPoP` proof header on the token request. The resulting token gets `token_type: DPoP` and a `cnf.jkt` claim binding it to the client's keypair — a stolen DPoP-bound token is useless without the private key. See [DPoP concept](../../concepts/dpop-and-proof-of-possession.md) and the [Auth Client SDK guide](sdk-auth-client.md#5-optional-sender-constrain-with-dpop) for the agent-side code.
