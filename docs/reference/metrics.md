# Metrics

The authorization server registers all metric instruments at startup in [`internal/observability/metrics.go`](../../internal/observability/metrics.go). Metrics are exported via the Prometheus endpoint (`GET /metrics` on the admin port) and / or pushed via OTLP, depending on `observability.metrics.provider` (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)).

Histograms use a sub-second latency bucket layout — `0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10` seconds — declared as `latencyBuckets` in [`internal/observability/metrics.go`](../../internal/observability/metrics.go).

The `Labels` column lists the OTel attributes that emit sites attach via `metric.WithAttributes(...)`. Where the registration itself attaches no labels, the column shows `(none)`; emit sites may still add request-scoped attributes (e.g. `grant_type`, `outcome`, `reason`) — grep the emit sites in `internal/services/` and `internal/observability/httpmw.go` to see the full label set in production exports.

## Counters

| Name | Type | Labels (emit-site) | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authserver_tokens_issued_total` | counter | grant_type | Total tokens issued | `TokensIssued` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_tokens_refreshed_total` | counter | (none) | Total tokens refreshed | `TokensRefreshed` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_tokens_revoked_total` | counter | reason (`family_revocation` / `code_reuse` / `explicit` / `explicit_machine`) | Total tokens revoked. `family_revocation` is refresh-token reuse, `code_reuse` is authorization-code reuse; both increment only once the family row is actually revoked | `TokensRevoked` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_auth_denied_total` | counter | reason | Total auth requests denied | `AuthDenied` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_audit_events_dropped_total` | counter | action (the dropped event's audit action) | Audit events that could not be persisted (the audit store is best-effort; the full event is emitted to the structured log instead) | `AuditEventsDropped` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_clients_registered_total` | counter | source (`dcr` / `admin`) | Total clients registered | `ClientsRegistered` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_cimd_fetch_suppressed_total` | counter | reason (`negative_cache` / `single_flight` / `capacity`) | Outbound CIMD fetches that did not happen, by the control that stopped them: a recently-failed target not re-fetched, a concurrent request that rode an in-progress fetch, or a request shed because the global in-flight limit was full. The CIMD fetch path is reachable from an unauthenticated `GET /oauth/authorize` with a caller-chosen URL, so a sustained rate here means fetches are being driven, not that clients are registering | `CIMDFetchSuppressed` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_consent_decisions_total` | counter | decision (`granted` / `denied`) | Total consent decisions | `ConsentDecisions` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_login_attempts_total` | counter | outcome | Total login attempts | `LoginAttempts` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_refresh_token_reuse_total` | counter | (none) | Total refresh token reuse detections | `RefreshTokenReuse` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_auth_code_reuse_total` | counter | verifier (`valid` / `invalid`) | Authorization-code replay detections, counted on every replay before any credential is proved. The label is on the CAUSE, not the outcome: `valid` means the replayer proved PKCE **and** presented the session's own `client_id`, so revocation was attempted; `invalid` covers a wrong verifier, a mismatched `client_id`, or both — the replay could never have been redeemed and nothing is revoked. Whether an attempted revocation succeeded is reported by `authserver_tokens_revoked_total{reason="code_reuse"}` and `authserver_revocation_failures_total{path="code_reuse"}` | `AuthCodeReuse` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_revocation_failures_total` | counter | path (`reuse` / `code_reuse`), half (`family` / `jti`) | Token revocations where a half failed: `family` — nothing revoked, family still live; `jti` — access-token JTIs not denylisted. Each half reports only itself (one detection can emit both), so `jti` alone does not say the family was revoked — check `half="family"`. Both reuse-detection paths emit it: `reuse` is refresh-token reuse, `code_reuse` is authorization-code reuse | `RevocationFailures` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_oidc_jwks_cache_hits_total` | counter | (none) | Total OIDC JWKS cache hits | `OIDCJWKSCacheHits` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_oidc_jwks_cache_misses_total` | counter | (none) | Total OIDC JWKS cache misses | `OIDCJWKSCacheMisses` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_introspection_total` | counter | active (bool) | Total token introspections | `IntrospectionTotal` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authserver_key_rotation_total` | counter | (none) | Total signing key rotations | `KeyRotationTotal` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |

| `authplane_client_credentials_issued_total` | counter | (none) | Total client credentials tokens issued | `ClientCredentialsIssued` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authplane_client_credentials_denied_total` | counter | reason | Total client credentials requests denied | `ClientCredentialsDenied` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |

| `authplane_token_exchange_denied_total` | counter | reason | Total token exchange operations denied | `TokenExchangeDenied` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
| `authplane_agent_tokens_issued_total` | counter | (none) | Total tokens issued with agent identity claims | `AgentTokensIssued` in `internal/observability/metrics.go` |
