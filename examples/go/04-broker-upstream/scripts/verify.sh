# verify.sh — end-to-end smoke for Tier 04 (Go broker + RFC 8693 + consent).
#
# Pipeline (mirrors the Python and TypeScript tier-04 scripts):
#   1. wait for authserver discovery (:9000) and confirm token-exchange is
#      advertised in `grant_types_supported`
#   2. register the upstream broker provider (POST /admin/broker-providers)
#   3. register an actor MCP (Mint resource). The broker dispatch path
#      identifies the actor MCP via policy.runtime.client_ids list-membership
#      (token_exchange.go:1244-1314); without this row the exchange would be
#      rejected with `unauthorized_client` before any consent check runs.
#   4. register the Broker resource bound to the provider, with a scope
#      catalog (POST /admin/resources, backend_kind=broker)
#   5. register the acting confidential client with BOTH
#      `client_credentials` (so the verify pipeline can mint the
#      subject_token below) AND
#      `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` (the grant the
#      agent itself uses). Public clients cannot perform token exchange —
#      see docs/guides/upstream-providers/token-exchange-grant.md step 2.
#   6. bind the client to the actor MCP (POST
#      /admin/resources/{actor}/policy/runtime/client-ids) so
#      resolveActorMCP succeeds at exchange time.
#   7. add the client to policy.exchange.allowed_client_ids on the broker
#      resource (POST /admin/resources/{slug}/policy/exchange/allowed-clients)
#   8. mint a `client_credentials` token via POST /oauth/token. This is the
#      service-account access token the agent presents as `subject_token`;
#      it stands in for the user-issued access token an MCP server would
#      forward verbatim in a real deployment. Persisted to .env so main.go
#      can read it via AUTHPLANE_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN.
#   9. `go run ./` the agent. The agent attempts the token exchange, gets
#      back `consent_required` from the AS (no consent_grants row exists
#      for this user/agent/resource, and there's no admin endpoint to seed
#      one — consent_grants and broker_grants are written only by the real
#      interactive `/connect/<provider>` flow), catches
#      `*authplane.ConsentRequiredError`, prints the `consent_url` an
#      operator would surface to a real user, and exits 2.
#  10. assert the agent exited 2 and that its stdout contains the
#      consent_url banner. THAT is the tier-04 demonstration: every
#      production agent has to handle this branch, and this is what it
#      looks like.
#
# Exits 0 on full success. Any failure prints the offending response and exits 1.
