# Tier 02 — Calling another resource from your MCP server (TypeScript)

<!-- loccount:begin -->
**Auth-specific code: 6 lines · Total example: 62 lines · SDK: ts-sdk 0.4.0**
<!-- loccount:end -->

When your MCP server needs to call another resource — another Mint MCP
server, an admin service, any backend that trusts Authplane — it
acquires a token via the `@authplane/sdk` Auth Client. This example
isolates that outbound OAuth call so you can see what the SDK does:
build a client, request a `client_credentials` token, present it on the
call. In your real MCP server, this code lives inside the tool handler
that needs to talk to the other resource.

> **Pairs with tier 01.** Tier 01 plays "the resource being called" —
> its authserver (`:9000` / `:9001`) and MCP server (`:8080`) must be
> running before `make verify` here. Bring it up first with `make run`
> in [`../01-mcp-server-basic/`](../01-mcp-server-basic/).
>
> The standalone `agent.ts` shape is purely for readability: in
> production the same SDK calls live inside an MCP server's tool
> handler, not in a sibling process.

## What you'll learn

- How to acquire a `client_credentials` access token from Authplane using
  the `@authplane/sdk` `AuthplaneClient`
- How to bind the issued token to a specific
  [Resource](../../../docs/concepts/glossary.md#glossary-resource) via the
  `resource=` parameter so the JWT `aud` claim matches the server you're
  calling
- How to attach the bearer token to an MCP JSON-RPC request and parse the
  streamable-http response
- How the agent side of a machine-to-machine MCP flow stays tiny when the
  SDK owns metadata discovery, token caching, and the circuit breaker

|---|---|
| **Time to run** | ~2 minutes (after tier 01 is already up) |
| **Prereqs** | Node.js 22+, `curl`, `jq`, tier 01 running |
| **SDK** | `@authplane/sdk` 0.4.0 (npm) |
| **Runtime** | Node.js 22 + `tsx`, plain `fetch` against the MCP streamable-http transport |

## Run it in 3 commands

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make run
make verify
```

`make run` installs the agent's dependencies but does not start any
long-running service — the agent is a one-shot client. `make verify`
waits for tier 01 to be up, registers an OAuth client + Mint resource
against the tier-01 authserver, then runs the agent once via `tsx`. The
agent mints a token and calls the tier-01 `echo` tool. `make clean`
removes the `.env` file the run target created; `make distclean` also
removes `node_modules`.

## Step by step

The `make verify` script automates every step below; the bullets here
describe what's happening so you can reproduce the flow by hand.

> If you want to run the curl examples manually instead of via `make verify`,
> first load the env vars and capture client credentials as you go:
>
> ```bash
> set -a; source .env; set +a   # exports AUTHPLANE_ADMIN_API_KEY etc.
> ```
>
> Step 3 emits `client_id` and `client_secret` in its response; assign each
> to a shell variable (`CLIENT_ID=...`, `CLIENT_SECRET=...`) before steps 4
> and 5 use them. Step 5 hands those credentials to the agent, which mints
> the access token itself inside the SDK — you never need to see the raw
> token to verify the flow works.

1. **Bring up tier 01.** This example is a pure client — the authserver
   and MCP server are the ones tier 01 starts.

   ```bash
   cd ../01-mcp-server-basic
   make run
   curl -fsS http://localhost:9000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
   ```

2. **Register a Mint Resource.** The Resource URI must match the JWT
   audience the tier-01 MCP server expects (`AUTHPLANE_RESOURCE`,
   defaulting to `http://localhost:8080/mcp`).

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:9001/admin/resources \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHPLANE_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "slug": "demo-mcp",
       "uri": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
       "backend_kind": "mint",
       "display_name": "Demo MCP",
       "scopes": [{"name": "mcp:echo", "description": "echo tool"}]
     }'
   ```

   The same Resource can be created via the CLI inside the tier-01
   authserver container. The canonical path is `admin resource create`
   (see
   [`docs/reference/cli.md#cli-admin-resource-create`](../../../docs/reference/cli.md#cli-admin-resource-create)):

   ```bash
   docker exec authplane-tier01-as \
     /authserver admin resource create \
       --slug demo-mcp \
       --uri http://localhost:8080/mcp \
       --backend-kind mint \
       --display-name "Demo MCP" \
       --scopes 'mcp:echo||echo tool'
   ```

   Note the pipe-delimited `'name|upstream|description'` tuple syntax —
   the double-empty middle is intentional for Mint scopes (no upstream
   mapping). If the resource already exists from a prior tier-01 run,
   the AS returns 409 and `verify.sh` continues.

3. **Register an OAuth client for the agent.** A `client_credentials`
   machine client needs the matching grant type and a confidential auth
   method.

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:9001/admin/clients \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHPLANE_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "client_name": "demo-agent-ts",
       "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
       "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
       "scope": "mcp:echo"
     }'
   ```

   The response carries `client_id` and `client_secret`. The secret is
   shown once — capture it into `CLIENT_ID` / `CLIENT_SECRET`.

4. **Run the agent.** Export the captured credentials and invoke the
   agent — `@authplane/sdk` performs RFC 8414 discovery, requests a
   `client_credentials` token at `POST /oauth/token`, and the agent then
   POSTs an authenticated JSON-RPC `tools/call` to the MCP server.

   The agent runs natively on the host, so it reaches the AS and the
   MCP server at their localhost ports. The SDK enforces that the
   discovered issuer matches the configured one byte for byte, so use the
   same `http://localhost:9000` value tier 01's AS announces.

   ```bash
   AUTHPLANE_ISSUER=http://localhost:9000 \
   AUTHPLANE_RESOURCE=http://localhost:8080/mcp \
   AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_ID="$CLIENT_ID" \
   AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_SECRET="$CLIENT_SECRET" \
   MCP_URL=http://localhost:8080/mcp \
   npx tsx agent.ts
   ```

   `AUTHPLANE_RESOURCE` stays at the public `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
   URI — it is a logical audience identifier (the token's `aud` claim
   and the registered Mint resource URI), not a network address. The
   tier-01 MCP server validates inbound JWTs against this exact value.

   Expected output: two `[agent] ... OK` lines — one for the `initialize`
   handshake and one for the `echo` tool call that bounces the
   `ECHO_TEXT` string back.

## Before / After

An MCP client without auth — a single unauthenticated POST:

```diff
- const res = await fetch(MCP_URL, {
-   method: "POST",
-   headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
-   body: JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc: "2.0", id: 1, method: "tools/call", params }),
- });
```

The same client with Authplane token acquisition:

```diff
+ import { AuthplaneClient } from "@authplane/sdk/core";
+ const ap = await AuthplaneClient.create({
+   issuer: process.env.AUTHPLANE_ISSUER!,
+   auth: { clientId: process.env.AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_ID!, clientSecret: process.env.AUTHPLANE_CLIENT_SECRET! },
+ });
+ const token = await ap.clientCredentials(["mcp:echo"], [process.env.AUTHPLANE_RESOURCE!]);
  const res = await fetch(MCP_URL, {
    method: "POST",
-   headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
+   headers: {
+     "Authorization": `Bearer ${token.accessToken}`,
+     "Content-Type": "application/json",
+     "Accept": "application/json, text/event-stream",
+   },
    body: JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc: "2.0", id: 1, method: "tools/call", params }),
  });
```

Five lines of auth code, inside the `// authplane:begin` / `// authplane:end`
markers in [`agent.ts`](./agent.ts). Run
`go run ./tools/loccount examples/typescript/02-agent-basic` from the
repo root to see the count.

## What's happening

`AuthplaneClient.create()` performs RFC 8414 AS metadata discovery against
`issuer`, learns the token endpoint, and primes an internal token cache
and circuit breaker. `clientCredentials(scopes, resources)` then POSTs to
`/oauth/token` with `grant_type=client_credentials`, the requested scope,
and one `resource=` value per element of the resources array (RFC 8707
resource indicators). Authplane validates the client and the requested scope against the
target Resource, then mints a JWT whose `aud` claim equals the resource
URI and returns it as `access_token`. The agent attaches the token as a
`Bearer` Authorization header on the MCP request. The tier-01 MCP
server's `bearerAuth` middleware validates the JWT signature against
the AS's JWKS, then checks `aud`, `exp`, and the required `mcp:echo`
scope before dispatching to the `echo` tool. The audience-bound token is
what makes this safe: even if leaked, it is only accepted by the resource
whose URI was bound at mint time.

## Next

[Tier 03 — FastMCP server + agent with DPoP](../03-mcp-server-fastmcp-dpop/)
layers RFC 9449 DPoP onto this flow, binding access tokens to a per-agent
keypair so a stolen token cannot be replayed from another host, and adds
per-tool scope enforcement.
[Tier 04](../04-broker-upstream/) puts an MCP server in front of a Broker
upstream (GitHub) with `ConsentRequiredError` handling.

## Use a locally-built authserver image

This example does not start its own authserver — tier 01 owns that. To
run tier 01 against an image built from this checkout rather than
`authplane/authserver:latest`, build it at the repo root and pass the tag
through `AUTHSERVER_IMAGE`:

```bash
( cd ../../.. && docker build -t authserver:dev -f build/Dockerfile . )
( cd ../01-mcp-server-basic && AUTHSERVER_IMAGE=authserver:dev make run )
```
