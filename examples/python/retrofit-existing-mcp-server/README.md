# Retrofit — Add Authplane to an existing FastMCP server (Python)

You already have an MCP server. It works. It has tools. It has no auth.
You want to add auth without rewriting your code.

This example shows exactly what that looks like — a real FastMCP server
in two states, **before** and **after** Authplane is wired in. They sit
side-by-side under `before/` and `after/`, and the smoke-test brings up
both at the same time to prove:

- **before** accepts a `tools/call` with no token → returns the tool result.
- **after** rejects the same call with 401 → then accepts it once you mint
  a bearer token. Same three tools either way.

## What changes — the actual diff

The auth code is in a single 5-line block, between `# authplane:begin` and
`# authplane:end` markers in `after/server.py`:

```diff
  import datetime as dt
+ import asyncio, os
  import secrets

  from fastmcp import FastMCP

- mcp = FastMCP("retrofit-demo")
- mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
+ from authplane_fastmcp import authplane_auth
+
+ async def main() -> None:
+     auth = await authplane_auth(
+         issuer=os.environ["AUTHPLANE_ISSUER"],
+         base_url=os.environ["AUTHPLANE_BASE_URL"],
+         scopes=["mcp:tools"], dev_mode=True,
+     )
+     mcp = FastMCP("retrofit-demo", **auth)
+     # ... @mcp.tool() registrations ...
+     try:
+         await mcp.run_async(transport="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
+     finally:
+         await auth.aclose()
+
+ asyncio.run(main())
```

`make diff` prints the same diff inline. The `# authplane:begin/end`
markers are what `tools/loccount` reads to enforce the "five lines" claim
in CI.

The `pyproject.toml` change is just two new dependencies (`authplane-sdk`
and `authplane-fastmcp`). Everything else — the tool definitions, the
`mcp.run(...)` transport, the FastMCP version pin — stays put.

## Prereqs

The Makefile's `check-prereqs` target enforces these on every `make run`; it
fails loud with an install hint if any are missing.

| Tool | Version | Install (macOS / Linux) |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.12+ (FastMCP requirement) | `brew install python@3.12` / `apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv` |
| **Docker** | 24+ (daemon running) | Docker Desktop / Rancher Desktop / [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/) |
| **curl** | any | preinstalled |
| **jq** | any | `brew install jq` / `apt install jq` |

The Makefile auto-picks `python3.13` → `python3.12` → `python3` on PATH. If
your system's `python3` is 3.11 or older and you have 3.12 installed
elsewhere, pass it explicitly: `PY=/path/to/python3.12 make run`.

The AS container needs ports **9000** (public) and **9001** (admin) free; the
two MCP servers bind **8080** (`before`) and **8090** (`after`). Conflicts
are the most common startup failure — see Troubleshooting below.

## Run it

```bash
make run        # creates a venv (first run only), starts the AS in a container, launches both servers natively
make verify     # proves: before accepts anything, after enforces auth
make diff       # shows the exact code change between before/ and after/
make logs       # tails the last 40 lines of each component's log
make status     # one-line health of the AS container + both Python processes
make clean      # stops processes + AS container; KEEPS .env (and the venv)
make distclean  # full reset including .env and .run/
```

The basic flow doesn't build any Dockerfiles. The AS is pulled as a
published image; the two MCP servers are plain Python processes that share
one virtualenv created at `.run/.venv`. First run downloads the AS image
(~30 MB) and installs FastMCP + the Authplane adapter into the venv;
subsequent runs start in seconds. `make run` auto-creates `.env` from
`.env.example` on first run.

If you also want to see what the example looks like when the MCP servers
are themselves containerised, run `make docker-run` / `make docker-clean`.
That path uses `docker-compose.yml` and the per-server Dockerfiles — same
code, same `make verify`, just longer first build (~1 min).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Time to run** | About a minute first-run (venv + AS pull); ~20 s warm |
| **MCP framework** | `before/`: `fastmcp >= 3.0, < 4` · `after/`: `fastmcp >= 3.2, < 4` — the 3.2 floor comes from `authplane-fastmcp` 0.4.0 (each matches its own `pyproject.toml`) |
| **SDK** | `authplane-fastmcp` 0.4.0 (in `after/` only) |

## Troubleshooting

The most common failures and what to do about them.

**`bind: address already in use` on `make run`**
Another Authplane example (or a stale container from this one) is sitting on
:9000, :9001, :8080, or :8090. Reset and retry:
```bash
make clean
docker ps -aq --filter name=authplane | xargs -r docker rm -f
make run
```

**`ERROR: ... is Python 3.11 but FastMCP needs 3.12+`**
The Makefile's prereq check caught a too-old Python. Install 3.12 or newer
(`brew install python@3.12` / `apt install python3.12`) and either let the
auto-detect find it, or pass explicitly: `PY=python3.12 make run`.

**`make verify` hangs at "waiting for ..."**
Something didn't come up. Inspect each component:
```bash
make status   # is everything actually running?
make logs     # last 40 lines from AS + before + after
```
The Authlib deprecation warning in `after.log` is normal; what you're
looking for is a real exception above the FastMCP banner.

**`make verify` Phase B.4 returns `invalid_token`**
You're hitting Authplane's #1 misconfiguration: the JWT audience doesn't
match. `authplane_auth()` derives the audience as `base_url + mcp_path`;
the Resource URI registered at the AS and the `resource=...` form param
on the token request must agree byte-for-byte. The default flow gets this
right; you'll only hit it if you changed `AFTER_PORT` or the
`mcp_path` argument.

**`ERROR: jq not found` from `make verify`**
The verify script depends on `jq` to parse the AS's JSON responses. Install
it with `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Debian/Ubuntu).

**Re-installing dependencies after editing `pyproject.toml`**
The venv is keyed on file mtime via `.run/.venv-ready`. If you edit either
`before/pyproject.toml` or `after/pyproject.toml`, the next `make run`
re-installs. To force a fresh venv unconditionally: `make distclean && make run`.

**`make distclean` vs. `make clean`**
`make clean` stops processes and the AS container but keeps `.env` (and the
venv, so the next run is fast). `make distclean` is the full reset — use
before sharing the directory or switching examples.

## What `make verify` proves

```text
Phase A — before  (no bearer)         → HTTP 200, tools/call add(17,25)=42
Phase B.1 — after (no bearer)         → HTTP 401   ← auth enforced
Phase B.2 — register Resource + Client at the AS
Phase B.3 — mint a client_credentials token
Phase B.4 — after (with bearer)       → HTTP 200, tools/call add(17,25)=42
```

The smoke-test runs the **same MCP request** against both servers. The
only thing that changes is the 5-line auth block in `after/server.py`.

## When to use this vs. tier-01

| Your situation | Start at |
|---|---|
| You have an existing FastMCP server, you want the minimal diff to add auth | **You're already there.** Read `after/server.py` next to `before/server.py`. |
| You're writing a new MCP server from scratch | [`../01-mcp-server-basic/`](../01-mcp-server-basic/) — same five lines, fewer files. |
| You also need DPoP-bound tokens and per-tool scope enforcement | [`../03-mcp-server-dpop-scopes/`](../03-mcp-server-dpop-scopes/) |

## Adapting this to your project

> To run the AS against *your own* already-running server (not this
> example's `after/`) and provision + mint + call entirely by hand with
> `curl`, follow [Run the AS standalone and point it at your own MCP server](../../../docs/guides/integrate/standalone-as-by-hand.md).

The same two constraints from tier-01 apply (verbatim) when you copy
this into your own codebase:

**1. The two issuer URLs must share the same hostname.** The AS reads
`AUTHPLANE_SERVER_ISSUER` (what hostname it bakes into every JWT's
`iss` claim). The SDK inside your MCP server reads `AUTHPLANE_ISSUER`
(where to fetch metadata). They MUST resolve to the same hostname or
the SDK's `metadata.issuer == config.issuer` check fails.

> **This is a decision, not a default — pick by topology and set both vars to the same host:**
> - **MCP server on the host, another machine, or public** → `http://localhost:9000` (or your real hostname) on both.
> - **MCP server in the same Docker network as the AS** → `http://authserver:9000` on both.
>
> Get it wrong and every call 401s with an opaque `invalid_token` — the token is valid, but the SDK discovered metadata at one host while the JWT's `iss` says another.

| Topology | `AUTHPLANE_SERVER_ISSUER` | `AUTHPLANE_ISSUER` |
|---|---|---|
| **AS in a container, MCP server on the host** (`make run` default, the common retrofit path) | `http://localhost:9000` | `http://localhost:9000` |
| Same docker network (`make docker-run`) | `http://authserver:9000` | `http://authserver:9000` |

The `.env.example` ships with the host-side defaults. Switch both URLs to `http://authserver:9000` before running `make docker-run`.

**2. The MCP endpoint path is part of the JWT audience.** The
`authplane_auth()` factory derives the audience as
`base_url + mcp_path` (default `mcp_path="/mcp"`). If you mount
FastMCP at a different path, pass `mcp_path="/your-path"` to
`authplane_auth(...)` **and** register the Resource URI as
`base_url + your-path` (byte-for-byte). Mismatches produce an opaque
`invalid_token` on every call.

## Before production

The `after/` server is wired for local development. Before deploying:

| Setting | Dev value (here) | Production value | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev_mode=True` in `authplane_auth(...)` | `True` | **`False`** (or remove — it's the default) | Relaxes the SDK's SSRF guard so it accepts `http://`, `localhost`, and private-network issuers. Leaving it on in production weakens defense-in-depth against SSRF. |
| `AUTHPLANE_ISSUER` | `http://authserver:9000` | `https://auth.example.com` | Production issuers MUST be `https://`. The AS itself refuses to start with a non-localhost issuer unless cookies are also `Secure`. |
| `AUTHPLANE_SESSION_SECURE` | `true` | `true` | Required by the AS's startup validation whenever `server.issuer` is non-localhost. |
| `AUTHPLANE_ADMIN_API_KEY` | `dev-admin-key-change-me` | `openssl rand -hex 32` | Bearer for the entire admin surface. Treat like a root password. |
| Storage | SQLite in a Docker volume | PostgreSQL (`AUTHPLANE_STORAGE_DRIVER=postgres`) | SQLite is single-instance; PostgreSQL is required for HA. |
| Signing keys | Auto-generated in `/data/keys` | HashiCorp Vault Transit | See [`docs/guides/deploy/hashicorp-vault-transit.md`](../../../docs/guides/deploy/hashicorp-vault-transit.md). |

## What this example deliberately does not cover

- **Per-tool scope enforcement.** All three tools accept the same
  `mcp:tools` scope. For different scopes per tool (e.g. read-only vs
  write), see [`../03-mcp-server-dpop-scopes/`](../03-mcp-server-dpop-scopes/).
- **DPoP-bound tokens.** Bearer-only here. See tier-03 for proof-of-
  possession.
- **Calling another resource from inside a tool.** See
  [`../02-agent-basic/`](../02-agent-basic/).
- **Fronting an upstream provider (GitHub, Slack, ...).** See
  [`../04-broker-upstream/`](../04-broker-upstream/).

## Use a locally-built authserver image

The default `make run` does `docker run authplane/authserver:latest`.
To run the AS from your own checkout instead, build the image once and
override the tag:

```bash
# from the repo root
docker build -t authplane/authserver:dev .
# back in this directory
AS_IMAGE=authplane/authserver:dev make run
```

For the docker-compose flow (`make docker-run`), edit `docker-compose.yml`
and replace the `image:` line under the `authserver:` service with the
`build:` block from
[`../../_shared/docker-compose.authserver.yml`](../../_shared/docker-compose.authserver.yml).
