# verify.sh — end-to-end smoke for Tier 04 (Python).
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. wait for authserver discovery (:9000) and confirm
#      grant_types_supported advertises RFC 8693.
#   2. register a Broker provider `github-stub` (POST /admin/broker-providers).
#      Endpoints point at example.invalid URLs — the example never actually
#      hits them; the consent step would in a real deployment.
#   3. register a Mint resource `mcp-agent` (POST /admin/resources) — this
#      is the actor MCP the agent's client_id is bound to. The Broker
#      dispatch path needs this to look up consent_grants for the
#      agent-attestation gate (see internal/services/token_exchange.go
#      :1244-1314).
#   4. register a Broker resource `github` backed by `github-stub`
#      (POST /admin/resources with backend_kind=broker).
#   5. register an OAuth client with both `client_credentials` and the
#      token-exchange grant types (POST /admin/clients).
#   6. authorize the client AS the `mcp-agent` Mint resource
#      (POST /admin/resources/mcp-agent/policy/runtime/client-ids) so that
#      `resolveActorMCP(req.ClientID)` succeeds at exchange time.
#   7. authorize the client to act AS the `github` Broker resource
#      (POST /admin/resources/github/policy/exchange/allowed-clients).
#   8. run the agent. It mints a base `client_credentials` token, then
#      attempts a Token Exchange against the Broker resource. The AS
#      returns `consent_required` with a `consent_url` (no consent_grants
#      row on file → bound-B fails first). The agent catches
#      `ConsentRequiredError` and prints the `consent_url` — that IS the
#      tier-04 demonstration. In a real deployment the user would visit
#      that URL and the retry would succeed.
#
# Exits 0 on full success. Any failure prints the offending response and
# exits 1.
